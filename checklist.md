# Dataset Exploration & Data preprocessing
## Dataset selection
- [x] Pick a dataset
## Data preprocessing
- [x] **Data Preparation**: make sure the dataset is ready for machine learning algorithms. Clean the data, remove outliers, handle missing values, etc. You have seen these techniques in earlier courses.
- [x] **Feature Engineering**: create new features from the existing features. Sometimes it's better to create new features than to use the existing features. Also think about how to encode categorical features, normalize features, etc.
- [x] **Feature Selection**: remove features that are not useful to improve the performance of the models
- [x] **Create useful visuals**: in order to better understand the data create visuals which help to understand the data (use matplotlib, seabornLinks to an external site.,... to discover possible correlations)
- [x] **Hypothesis formulation**: map out possible hypothesis about the data. It is not forbidden to apply appropriate statistical tests on your hypothesis.

# Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
Build machine learning models for the dataset. You can choose your own target variable and the features that you want. Depending on your target variable, you'll be dealing with a classification or a regression problem. You can use any machine learning algorithm that you want, but try out multiple models. You can use any metric that you want to evaluate the performance of the models. You can also use multiple metrics. You can use any hyperparameter tuning technique that you want. You can also use multiple techniques. The goal is to get the best performance possible. The following concepts are part of this part of the assignment:

- [ ] **Model Evaluation**: evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms, use appropriate metrics, and validation techniques.
- [ ] **Model Selection**: explore the best models for your dataset. Compare the models using cross validation. Record your progress. It is not forbidden to apply techniques not seen in this course, but deep learning techniques are not allowed (see T2 for deep learning assignment)
- [ ] **TIP**: ensemble methods can be very useful to improve the overall performance.
- [x] **Hyperparameter Tuning**: tune the hyperparameters of the models using search methods.

Remember modelling is an iterative process, we try over and over again with other models and other hyper parameters to come up in the end with the best result. Start with a simple model and improve step by step by applying more sophisticated models on the data. Do not leave out the simple models. We need to see the whole process!
