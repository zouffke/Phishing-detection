    "At the end of the Hyper parameter tuning notebook we used the tuning class we created ourselves to save the chosen model to a file called: random_forest.pkl. This file can then be used by a custom python script (predict.py) to predict a new URL. The predict script will take the given url. Convert it to it's corresponding features. Afterwards it will normalize these values with the values used in the normalization notebook. These values are then passed to the model to predict if the passed url is legit or phishing. "
